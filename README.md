A look at how Instagram uses data to analyse trends and provide better results.

Task Description

This project is about the users who are on Instagram and extracting the insights that are then used by teams throughout the business to launch a new marketing campaign, choose which features to build for an app, track the success of the app by measuring user engagement, and improve the overall experience while aiding in business growth. It provides a brief overview of Instagram users' behaviour and population density.

Approach

The strategy is straightforward because we'll use a sql command to use the database as tables and then use a number of commands to pull insights from it.

A) Marketing: To launch a few campaigns, the marketing team wants to
Most devoted users are those who have been on the system the longest and deserve rewards. The five oldest Instagram users from the database had to be provided.
Sending them promotional emails will remind inactive users to start posting their first image. Users who have never uploaded a single photo to Instagram are given the task.

Contest Winner Announcement: The team has created a contest in which the user who receives the most likes on a single photo will be declared the winner. Identifying the contest winner and giving the team their information is the task.

Hastag Researching : A partner brand is conducting research on hashtags to determine which ones to use in a post to attract the largest audience possible. Your Job: Determine and offer the top 5 hashtags that are most frequently used on the platform.

Start an ad campaign : The team is attempting to determine the optimal day to debut ads. What day of the week do the majority of customers register? The knowledge of when to plan a marketing campaign


B) Investor Metrics: In order to determine whether Instagram is performing well and avoiding becoming obsolete like Facebook, our investors will evaluate the app on the following criteria.

User Engagement: Are Instagram users still active and posting regularly, or are they doing so less frequently? How frequently does the typical Instagram user post? Additionally, the total number of Instagram users and photos.

Investors want to know whether the platform is overrun with bots and phoney accounts. The information about the people (bots) that have liked each and every picture on the website, as a typical user is unable to accomplish this.
